### Kreativstorm 
## Trainig hand-on program 
trainig program divide in 5 weeks were practice concepts fundamentals and practice complex problems daylry 
# Week 1
Duriong this week star practice with conditional, error handling problems for detect diferents types of errors and how implement in the code
proyect euler resolb diferent problems like fibonacci sequence and practice diferent matematical operations 

In this practice review the conditional and resolve diferent problems using the most using functions
```   
def main():
    value = input('Give my a string')
    
    if value == value[::-1]:
        print('string is palindrome')
    else:
        print('String isnt palindrome')
